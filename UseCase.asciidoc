Possible Use Case
=================

Multi signature transactions are an integral part to Bitcoin script since it's beginning, and there are many proven and theoretical problems that can be solved with this technology. This is a critical theoretical analysis of these proposed use cases.

Security
--------

2-of-3 or 4-of-5 multisig, with one key controlled by the security speciallistfootnote:[See BitGo and Casa], and all others by clients. Approval / 2FA for each spend, but no full custody and risk of loss of keys.

Group Fund Management
---------------------

Business partners share access to funds in a n-of-n multi sig, so that all peers need to agree on the allocation of funds. Potentially improved with optional time locks. [2-of-2 always, 1-of-2 after 1000 blocks]

Escrow
------

Upfront security deposit for a market place / exchange, with semi-trusted third party arbitrator to sign in case of dispute.footnote:[See Bisq 2-of-3 & HodlHodl 2-of-2]
